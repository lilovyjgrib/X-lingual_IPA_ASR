# X-lingual_IPA_ASR
Recognize phonemes in Yoruba through a model trained on phonemes in English

Based on TBD. 

A project for the Universitaet Tuebingen ASR course (2025) 

## What is a phoneme-level model and IPA?

Using a grapheme to phoneme tools or a dataset annotated for phonemes, we train a CTC model to map audio sequence to a phoneme sequence (with no intermediate steps like standard orthography or vocabulary). For interlinguistic compatibility, we convert the phonemes to be represented in [IPA](). 

## English ‚Üí Yoruba and linguistic generalisation

Regardless of the orthography languages draw their sounds from a universal set of types. Linguists worked out how similar these prototypical sounds are. [link] To a lage extent what sound types a language uses is studied, here we draw data from [PHOIBLE](). This implies that, if two languages use a similar set, some skills in recognizing the sounds of one language can be transferred to the sounds of another. How well?

## üîß Current Status

This is a basic project skeleton to get the idea.  
We are currently setting up the pipeline, preprocessing the dataset and planning the logic.

## ‚úÖ To do

- [ ] Preprocess English & Yoruba data, set up target phonemes and correspondences
- [ ] Train phoneme model (CTC) on English
- [ ] Evaluate on Yoruba
- [ ] Analyze the performance, visualize phoneme confusion
- [ ] Report

## Dependencies
